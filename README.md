How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is secure and functional by addressing the requirements as well as implementing extensive testing that has a high coverage percentage. By having a high coverage percentage we can ensure that the requirements of the of the software are met. Making sure that the code is functional means following the requirements so that the software actually does what it was intended to do.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are interpreted by first reading and understanding them and then determining the best way to address those needs within the program. Once we figure out the best way to incorporate the needs into a program, it is important to test the code to make sure it functions and fully addresses the needs. 

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by using the requirements of the program to dictate the design. I then identify objects and methods that are needed to address those requirements and implement them into a program. After the objects and methods are identified, I begin writing the code that will meet the requirements. Once the code is written and functioning, it is important to test it to make sure that all the requirements are met and covered in the program.
